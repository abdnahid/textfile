A Carry is the hero that the team rallies around in the late game. The role's name is derived from the act of "carrying" a team, which is to bear the responsibility of leading the team to victory. The carry is expected to have the largest contribution to the team, and is critical in winning team fights. Carries typically lack early game power, but scale to be stronger in the late game. They are highly dependent on items to be successful. Carries often have a built-in farming mechanism to achieve this. Carries also rely on strong and fast physical attacks, but this is not always the case. Having more than one carry can potentially cause competition within your team for resources, which typically results in a number of underpowered carries. For certain team compositions, it is highly recommended that a team have only one hard carry (a hero with strong carry potential but weaker potential in other roles) and as the game progresses the hard carry will secure the majority of the kills. A semi carry (hero that has a bit less carry potential but stronger potential in other roles) that has gained a big enough gold advantage can also end up being the main damage dealer for the team. Carries are typically sent to the safe lane in the early game with one or more supports to protect them until they are strong enough to farm independently.
