Supports are heroes who keep their allies alive and give them opportunities to earn more gold and experience. Supports will usually come with skills such as healing spells or disables, and generally have low damage output but a powerful (yet situational) nuke. Supports are typically not dependent on items. Most of their gold is spent on items for the benefit of the team, such as an Animal Courier, Observer Wards, or Sentry Wards.
