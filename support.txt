Supports are heroes who keep their allies alive and give them opportunities to earn more gold and experience. Supports will usually come with skills such as healing spells or disables, and generally have low damage output but a powerful (yet situational) nuke. Supports are typically not dependent on items. Most of their gold is spent on items for the benefit of the team, such as an Animal Courier, Observer Wards, or Sentry Wards.

Supports are paired with the team's carry at the start of a game. This is because the carry tends to be the weakest and most gold-hungry member of the team. A support should always try to forfeit kills to their team's carry, only securing the kill if none of their allies are able to do it. To protect and help their team control the lane in the early stages of the game is of high importance for a support. They are able to repel enemies and assist in lane survival. Common traits of supports are long range attacks and defensive abilities.
