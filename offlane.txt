The Offlane is adjacent to your secret shop and ancient camps. Due to the short reinforcement distance, your creeps will often end up on the opponent's side of the river, leaving you in a vulnerable position next to their jungle. Being susceptible to heroes coming through the river makes this a more challenging lane, however strategically the Offlane is usually run solo for the Offlaner to quickly gain exp to leave the lane at level 6 and gank. The name "Offlane" refers to the play style of running the lane, in which the hero is rarely seen last hitting in lane. They are instead staying "Offlane" at the safest distance possible to gain experience.
